The problem is about Betty saving money for a wallet that costs $100. She has half of the money she needs. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents. The question is how much more money she needs.\\n\\nFirst, Betty has half of the $100. So half of 100 is 50. So Betty's initial amount is $50.\\n\\nThen, her parents give her $15. So adding that to her initial 50, she has 50 + 15 = $65.\\n\\nHer grandparents give her twice as much as her parents. So twice 15 is 30. Adding that to her current 65, she has 65 + 30 = $95.\\n\\nNow, the total she has is $95, and the wallet costs $100. So the difference is $100 - $95 = $5. \\n\\nTherefore, Betty needs $5 more.
